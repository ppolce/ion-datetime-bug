# ion-datetime-bug

This app was created with `ionic start ion-datetime-bug blank`
Then the home.page.html was edited to add an `<ion-datetime>` component.

The date and time pickers do not render correctly on some android devices (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S21) when the font size is set to maximum, 
as reported here: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/25964
